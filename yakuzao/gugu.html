            <div style="width: 75%;"><p><b>Goro Majima</b> (真島 吾朗, Majima Gorō) is a recurring major character in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series introduced in the original Yakuza. He is featured as a protagonist in Yakuza 0, Yakuza: Dead Souls, and the Majima Saga of Yakuza Kiwami 2. He is also featured as a supporting character in Yakuza/Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza 2/Yakuza Kiwami 2, Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4, Yakuza 5, Yakuza 6, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.
                <br>His unpredictability, ferocity in combat, and accomplishments as the captain of the Shimano Family earned him the nickname "The Mad Dog of Shimano" (嶋野の狂犬, Shimano no Kyōken). He is the former patriarch of the Majima Family, the founder and former president of Majima Construction, and the former vice-chairman of the Tojo Clan.

                <br>
                <br>Majima has a lean build, which he utilizes to achieve incredible levels of speed and agility. His hair is styled into a side part that hangs to the tops of his ears, with the rest being shaved into an undercut. He also sports a full goatee.
                <br>In Yakuza 0, he wore his hair long enough to be pulled into a low ponytail, and was clean shaven with a stubbly mustache.
                <br>He is missing his left eye, which was gouged out for insubordination in 1985. His eyelid remains intact.

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Majima's tattoo covers his biceps and upper chest, stretching from his neck to the back of his thighs. It consists of a floral motif (similar to Shimano's), with a HannyaWP on his back and twin snakes wrapped around his arms and chest.
                <br>The Hannya mask has commonly been used to depict women who have turned into demons as a result of being consumed by sorrow, envy, or rage. Snakes are often associated with rebirth and transformation, due to their tendency to shed their skin.
                <br>In the original Yakuza, his tattoo is not the Hannya; it is instead a blue entity that resembles an Oni that only covers his left breast.</p></div>

He is an agent of the Daidoji Faction, the former fourth chairman of the Tojo Clan, the former manager of Morning Glory Orphanage, and a former taxi driver for Nagasu Taxi. Kiryu's legendary accomplishments and ascent through the ranks of the Tojo Clan's Dojima Family, as well as the dragon tattoo on his back, have earned him the nickname "The Dragon of Dojima" (堂島の龍, Dōjima no Ryū)1.

            <br>Kiryu has an extremely muscular build, seemingly as a result of constant street fights and various other activities in his daily routine rather than any concentrated effort to achieve this physique. He has more upper body mass than lower, which can most likely be attributed to his frequent use of fists and heavy weapons.For most of the series, Kiryu's hair is short and messily slicked back, standing up to a point at the front with prominent sideburns, and his facial hair is trimmed to a pure goatee. In Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, his hair has grayed completely and is styled with sideswept bangs. Kiryu is noted multiple times to be handsome, with brown eyes described as "beautiful" by Joji and Shintaro Kazama. When he prepares to confront Ebina, he slicks his hair back once more. One month after he was hospitalized, he looks noticeably thinner and his hair has become lighter.In Yakuza 0, Kiryu sported an even shorter spiky top hairstyle with shaved sideburns, and his face was clean shaven.

            <br>Kiryu's tattoo covers most of his back and ends just above his thighs. It depicts a white, gray, black, and red "Yinglong" or "Oryu"WP grasping a pearl, symbolizing power, wisdom, protection, and balance in Japanese culture. The pearl contains the Sanskrit character for the year of the monkey, relating to Kiryu's Chinese zodiac year (1968).Ferocious and brave protectors, dragons are typically associated with hot-tempered individuals, though Kiryu's silver-colored dragon also suggests purity of heart. During the events of Yakuza 0, only the outlines of the tattoo are present, but it has been seen in its completed state since then. The colors of red, white, gray, and black mirror the colors of Kiryu's iconic outfit.Utabori is the tattoo artist who designed Kiryu's dragon, and his signature (歌彫) is displayed on the left-hand side of the design.</p></div>
